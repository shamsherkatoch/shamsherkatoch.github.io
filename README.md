## Azure keys and secrets rotation
Rotating keys and secrets is a critical security practice to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your applications. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to build a solution for keys and secret rotation using Azure Key Vault and Azure DevOps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
2. **Azure Key Vault**: Set up an Azure Key Vault to store your keys and secrets.
3. **Azure DevOps**: Have an Azure DevOps organization and a project set up.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Create and Configure Azure Key Vault
1. **Create Key Vault**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Create a resource** > **Security** > **Key Vault**.
   - Fill in the necessary details and create the Key Vault.

2. **Add Secrets and Keys**:
   - Navigate to your Key Vault.
   - Under **Settings**, select **Secrets** or **Keys**.
   - Add the secrets or keys you want to manage.

#### Step 2: Set Up Azure DevOps Service Connection
1. **Service Connection**:
   - In Azure DevOps, go to your project.
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Service connections**.
   - Create a new service connection for Azure Resource Manager.
   - Authenticate and grant necessary permissions to allow Azure DevOps to access your Azure Key Vault.

#### Step 3: Create Azure DevOps Pipeline
1. **Create Pipeline**:
   - In your Azure DevOps project, go to **Pipelines** > **Create Pipeline**.
   - Select the repository where your code resides.

2. **Define Pipeline YAML**:
   - Use the following example YAML to set up a pipeline that will handle the rotation of secrets and keys:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   variables:
     azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection-name'
     keyVaultName: 'your-key-vault-name'
     secretName: 'your-secret-name'
     newSecretValue: 'new-secret-value' # Replace this with the method to generate new secret value

   stages:
   - stage: RotateSecrets
     jobs:
     - job: Rotate
       steps:
       - task: AzureCLI@2
         inputs:
           azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
           scriptType: 'bash'
           scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
           inlineScript: |
             az keyvault secret set --vault-name $(keyVaultName) --name $(secretName) --value $(newSecretValue)
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual service connection name, key vault name, secret name, and the method to generate a new secret value.

3. **Commit and Run**:
   - Commit the pipeline YAML file to your repository.
   - Run the pipeline to rotate the secret.

#### Step 4: Automate the Key Rotation
1. **Set Up Schedule**:
   - In Azure DevOps, you can set a schedule for your pipeline to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Navigate to your pipeline, click on **Triggers**, and set up the scheduled triggers.

2. **Add Notification**:
   - Configure notifications in Azure DevOps to alert you about the pipeline's success or failure.
   - Go to **Project Settings** > **Notifications**, and set up a new notification rule for pipeline completion.

### Additional Considerations
- **Key Rotation**: For key rotation, use similar steps but focus on keys instead of secrets. Azure CLI commands for keys are slightly different, for example:
  ```bash
  az keyvault key create --vault-name $(keyVaultName) --name $(keyName) --ops encrypt decrypt --kty RSA
  ```

- **Automate Secret Generation**: You can integrate the generation of new secret values with tools like Azure Functions or custom scripts to dynamically generate new values.

- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure that the service principal used in the Azure DevOps service connection has minimal necessary permissions, ideally limited to the Key Vault.

By following these steps, you can automate the rotation of keys and secrets stored in Azure Key Vault using Azure DevOps, enhancing the security of your applications.

# Accessing Azure Key Vault Using User Managed Identity in .NET Full Framework and .NET 6 Applications

## Introduction

Azure Key Vault provides a secure way to manage and access secrets, keys, and certificates. Using a User Managed Identity (UMI) simplifies access to Azure Key Vault by eliminating the need for credentials in the code. This paper explains how to configure and access Azure Key Vault using UMI in both .NET Full Framework and .NET 6 applications.

## Prerequisites

2. **Azure Key Vault**: An existing Key Vault instance.
3. **User Managed Identity**: A User Managed Identity created and assigned to the application.
4. **Development Environment**: Visual Studio or any other IDE supporting .NET development.

## Setting Up Azure Key Vault and User Managed Identity

1. **Create Azure Key Vault**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Security + Identity" > "Key Vault".
   - Configure the Key Vault and create it.

2. **Add Secrets to Key Vault**:
   - Navigate to the created Key Vault.
   - Go to "Secrets" and add new secrets.

3. **Create a User Managed Identity**:
   - Go to "Create a resource" > "Identity" > "User Managed Identity".
   - Create and configure the identity.

4. **Assign Managed Identity to Azure Key Vault**:
   - Navigate to the Key Vault's "Access policies".
   - Add a new access policy, select the User Managed Identity, and assign necessary permissions (e.g., Get, List secrets).

## Accessing Azure Key Vault in .NET Full Framework

### Step 1: Install NuGet Packages
Add the following NuGet packages to your project:
