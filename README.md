This makes Azure Landing Zones a highly valuable investment for organizations looking to optimize their cloud security and compliance posture effectively.

## Azure keys and secrets rotation
Rotating keys and secrets is a critical security practice to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your applications. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to build a solution for keys and secret rotation using Azure Key Vault and Azure DevOps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
2. **Azure Key Vault**: Set up an Azure Key Vault to store your keys and secrets.
3. **Azure DevOps**: Have an Azure DevOps organization and a project set up.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Create and Configure Azure Key Vault
1. **Create Key Vault**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Create a resource** > **Security** > **Key Vault**.
   - Fill in the necessary details and create the Key Vault.

2. **Add Secrets and Keys**:
   - Navigate to your Key Vault.
   - Under **Settings**, select **Secrets** or **Keys**.
   - Add the secrets or keys you want to manage.

#### Step 2: Set Up Azure DevOps Service Connection
1. **Service Connection**:
   - In Azure DevOps, go to your project.
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Service connections**.
   - Create a new service connection for Azure Resource Manager.
   - Authenticate and grant necessary permissions to allow Azure DevOps to access your Azure Key Vault.

#### Step 3: Create Azure DevOps Pipeline
1. **Create Pipeline**:
   - In your Azure DevOps project, go to **Pipelines** > **Create Pipeline**.
   - Select the repository where your code resides.

2. **Define Pipeline YAML**:
   - Use the following example YAML to set up a pipeline that will handle the rotation of secrets and keys:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   variables:
     azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection-name'
     keyVaultName: 'your-key-vault-name'
     secretName: 'your-secret-name'
     newSecretValue: 'new-secret-value' # Replace this with the method to generate new secret value

   stages:
   - stage: RotateSecrets
     jobs:
     - job: Rotate
       steps:
       - task: AzureCLI@2
         inputs:
           azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
           scriptType: 'bash'
           scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
           inlineScript: |
             az keyvault secret set --vault-name $(keyVaultName) --name $(secretName) --value $(newSecretValue)
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual service connection name, key vault name, secret name, and the method to generate a new secret value.

3. **Commit and Run**:
   - Commit the pipeline YAML file to your repository.
   - Run the pipeline to rotate the secret.

#### Step 4: Automate the Key Rotation
1. **Set Up Schedule**:

   - Navigate to your pipeline, click on **Triggers**, and set up the scheduled triggers.

2. **Add Notification**:
   - Configure notifications in Azure DevOps to alert you about the pipeline's success or failure.
   - Go to **Project Settings** > **Notifications**, and set up a new notification rule for pipeline completion.

### Additional Considerations
- **Key Rotation**: For key rotation, use similar steps but focus on keys instead of secrets. Azure CLI commands for keys are slightly different, for example:
  ```bash
  az keyvault key create --vault-name $(keyVaultName) --name $(keyName) --ops encrypt decrypt --kty RSA
  ```

- **Automate Secret Generation**: You can integrate the generation of new secret values with tools like Azure Functions or custom scripts to dynamically generate new values.

- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure that the service principal used in the Azure DevOps service connection has minimal necessary permissions, ideally limited to the Key Vault.

By following these steps, you can automate the rotation of keys and secrets stored in Azure Key Vault using Azure DevOps, enhancing the security of your applications.

### Step 2: Push Bicep Files to Azure Repos

1. **Create a Repository**: Create a new repository in your Azure DevOps project.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://dev.azure.com/your_organization/your_project/_git/your_repo
cd your_repo
```

3. **Add Bicep Files**: Add your Bicep files to the repository and push them.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add Bicep templates"
git push
```

### Step 3: Create an Azure Pipeline

1. **Create a Pipeline**: Go to Azure Pipelines in your Azure DevOps project and create a new pipeline.
2. **Select Repository**: Select the repository containing your Bicep files.
3. **Configure Pipeline**: Use the YAML configuration to define your pipeline.

**azure-pipelines.yml**

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection'
  resourceGroupName: 'myResourceGroup'
  location: 'East US'

stages:
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: DeployInfrastructure
    displayName: 'Deploy Azure Resources'
    steps:
    - task: AzureCLI@2
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
        scriptType: 'bash'
        scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
        inlineScript: |
          az group create --name $(resourceGroupName) --location $(location)
          az deployment group create --resource-group $(resourceGroupName) --template-file main.bicep --parameters location=$(location) resourceGroupName=$(resourceGroupName)
```

### Step 4: Configure Service Connection

1. **Service Connection**: In Azure DevOps, navigate to `Project Settings` -> `Service connections`.
2. **New Service Connection**: Create a new service connection of type `Azure Resource Manager` and grant access to your subscription.

### Step 5: Run the Pipeline

1. **Queue the Pipeline**: Go to Pipelines in Azure DevOps and run the newly created pipeline.
2. **Monitor the Pipeline**: Monitor the progress and ensure that the deployment is successful.

### Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, you can automate the deployment of an Azure Platform using Azure Bicep and Azure DevOps pipelines. This approach ensures a consistent, repeatable, and automated deployment process, providing a solid foundation for your Azure infrastructure.
